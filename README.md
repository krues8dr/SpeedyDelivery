# SpeedyDelivery

A php script to read in TinyLetter archives and outputs an RSS2 feed for readers.

## Installation

1. Drop the `speedydelivery.php` script on any server with PHP and load the script in your browser.
2. Enter the user's TinyLetter username in the form and submit it.
3. Copy the resulting URL from the browser and paste it into your RSS Reader.

Note: Some users do not use TinyLetter archives, so no RSS feed will be able to be generated.  The script will throw a 404 error in those cases.  Feel free to ask those users to add archives.
